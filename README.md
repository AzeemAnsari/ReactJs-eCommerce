## Introduction
This is a code repository for the ReactJs eCommerce web shop Application. 

In this web application, I have used commerce.js SDK (http://commercejs.com/) to steup the store and Strip API (http://stripe.com/) for card transaction.

### Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
